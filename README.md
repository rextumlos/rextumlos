# Hi there, I'm Rex 👋

# Glad to see you here!~~ ![HitCount](https://hits.dwyl.com/rextumlos/rextumlos.svg?style=flat-square)

I am a software engineer, musician, and a gamer. I love getting frustrated by code, playing drums, and reading books.

As a software engineer, I enjoy coding with having a feeling of discovering something ✨, and refactoring. 🧹

## My Personal Stuffs:
- 👨‍💻 I'm currently working on something cool.
- 🚀 I'm currently studying Ruby on Rails.
- 🎹 I want to learn how to play piano properly.
